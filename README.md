Assembling attacks and not only by a young hacker. Sorry I'm a beginner....
The program is made for entertainment and does not pursue any goals, especially illegal ones. I am not responsible for the program, for how it works, what it can do, and in principle, if it does not start, I do not care. I'm just learning and I'm pretty young in programming. So don't hit him if he doesn't even start :D. Links to resources may be needed, although I doubt that anyone will see this project.
Now I will gradually update about the program, I plan to break through the phone number. The program has: ESSIPA-weak DoS attack. CKSIPA is slightly better. TDR or Rise of the Devil, I want to tell you more about him. In it, unlike the previous ones, there are several offensive forces, 1 2 3 4 7. Yes, I did not add 5 and 6, because 7 can send at least 20 seconds to overclock with 1,000,000,000 bytes / sec. There are also 2 attacks on https. PaotS and HsAoS.
There is also ip punching and data entry into the picture, added for fun :)
